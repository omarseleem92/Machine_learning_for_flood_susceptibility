# Towards urban flood susceptibility mapping using data-driven models in Berlin, Germany
 
## Input data:
A sample for flooded and non flooded locations and the used predictive features in the paper are available on: https://zenodo.org/record/7472764#.Y6RHuxWZO70


## Description:
We compared convolutional neural networks (CNNs) (image-based model) with traditional machine learning algorithms such as random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM) and artificial neural networks (ANNs) to map urban flood susceptibility in Berlin, Germany. We used a flood inventory and eleven predictive features representing topographu, infrastructure and precipitation to develop the models. The results showed that the RF models outperformed other models and all the models performed well outside the training domain.
